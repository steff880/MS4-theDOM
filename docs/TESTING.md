## Bugs and Fixes

- Bug:

When testing if printing _**bag_items**_ will print the _**item_id**_, _**quantity**_ and the _**course*_, encountered few issues.

![Bag Bug](/docs/images/bag-bug.png)

As I was following the Boutique Ado mini project, unintentionally wrote _**product_count**_ instead of _**course_count**_. The other issue is, that I missed to append the _**course**_ in _**bag_items**_.

- Fix:

Change the variable _**product_count**_ to _**course_count**_ and append the _**course**_ in _**bag_items**_.

- Bug:

While testing the **Shopping bag page**, noticed that the **bag total** was not calculated properly. 
Instead of multiplying the _**quantity**_ by the _**price**_, it was adding the _**quantity**_ to the _**price**_.

- Fix:

Update the **bag total** to be calculated by multiplying the _**quantity**_ by the _**price**_

- Bug:

Issue calculating the **order total** correctly. 

When testing to see the order after checkout in admin panel, realized that **discount** is applied to orders _below_ the threshold ($30).

- Fix:

Change code to apply the discount only when the **total** is **_greater_** than **discount threshold**

- Bug:

When testing adding a course without image and try to access it it throws the error below. The reason is that on Course Detail page the link for couuse without image was wrong, and points to a non-existing image.

![No image](/docs/images/no-image-bug1.png)

- Fix:

Add {{ MEDIA_URL }}noimage.png in the _href_ attribute of the link.

- Bug:

Created new model and run migrations. It worked locally but seemed like the new model was not migrated to **Postgres**. Which resulted in this error.

- Fix:

Had a _Tutor Assistance_ and was suggested to create environmental variable in gitpod called **DATABASE_URL**, which value was the _url_ for **Postgres** and set **DEBUG** to false. Stop the workspace and start it again. After doing this, in the _terminal_ was a message that I need to run migrations to **Postgres**. I used the command `python3 manage.py migrate --plan`, which showed everything that needs to be migrated. Confirmed that it is correct and run `python3 manage.py migrate`. Then when I reloaded the deployed site all worked normally.



## Known Issues

 When initially planing for MS4 did not realize that, when I create a site about web dev courses, it will not be a good idea to let users choose quantity that is greater than 1.

Unfortunately when I relized it, was already too late to make big changes, due to really being pressed by the time, so I came up with the idea to disable the form submission if the maximum value is more than 2. Also disable the +/- buttons as well following the same logic. Also I did not want to start deleting code and end up breaking something, close to submission of my project. At least now user will not be able to purchase 99 courses. I know this solution is not the best, but it was all I was able to do at that point.

This issue will be fixed in future updates.

### W3C Validator Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were
no syntax errors in the project.

[W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

- One error and one warning was found for a duplicate ID used. The reason for thisis that there is a second file for mobile-top-navigation and it contains the same code as the one on the **base template**. It does not affect the functionality of the website.

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

- No errors found. All warnings are from bootstrap and vendor prefixes.

### [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

All code found valid. Few warnings for Jquery _$_ sign.


### Python code testing

The python extention was used to test for Pep8 compliance and linting.

- Most of the Python errors were fixed during development

- Any errors related to files auto generated by Django were left untouched.

    - Migration files
    - Project `settings.py`
    - ./manage.py file
    - checkout/init.py

- The errors related to the variable **'e'** were left untouched

    - Variable 'e' here is used to capture any errors from the Stripe webhook handler.

- **'checkout.signals'** not being used in ./checkout/apps.py

    - The import is used to let Django know there a signals module, listening for changes to automatically updating the totals

- Line too long erros

    - Most of line too long errors were fixed during development
