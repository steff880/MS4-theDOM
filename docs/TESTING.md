## Bugs and Fixes

- Bug:

When testing if printing _**bag_items**_ will print the _**item_id**_, _**quantity**_ and the _**course*_, encountered few issues.

![Bag Bug](/docs/images/bag-bug.png)

As I was following the Boutique Ado mini project, unintentionally wrote _**product_count**_ instead of _**course_count**_. The other issue is, that I missed to append the _**course**_ in _**bag_items**_.

- Fix:

Change the variable _**product_count**_ to _**course_count**_ and append the _**course**_ in _**bag_items**_.
